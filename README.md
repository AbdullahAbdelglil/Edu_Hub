## üî¥ Project Overview

Edu_Hub stands as an innovative educational platform, meticulously crafted using advanced Hibernate mappings alongside the robust Spring ecosystem, which encompasses Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and RESTful services.

The project revolves around five fundamental entities:

1. **Instructor**
2. **InstructorDetail**
3. **Course**
4. **CourseReview**

2. **List of Reviews:** Illustrates a many-to-one, uni-directional relationship.
3. **List of Students:** Exhibits a many-to-many, bi-directional relationship.

### ‚ö™ Student Entity

1. **List of Courses:** Demonstrates a many-to-many, bi-directional relationship.
